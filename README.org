#+title: Yomibaba

* Background

This is a temporary fork of Yomichan with just one additional, but very useful,
feature.

The feature added supports exporting and importing the entire IndexedDB
database of dictionaries that have been imported by Yomichan. This lets you
track only one file (or two, if you want to copy the same settings too) when
you want to migrate between browsers and devices, or indeed when you just want
to share your settings with newer people without giving them a mountain of
drudgery to tackle first. Backups also become more manageable. It is also
significantly faster to load all the data this way since it avoids all the
parsing and validation that Yomichan typically does. Of course, that means the
data could be invalid too but I haven't run into problems yet after importing
database that was actually properly exported.

I have renamed user-facing references to =Yomibaba= to respect the wishes of
the developer of Yomichan to sunset the Yomichan name but I didn't go the whole
mile of renaming all the inner files and such because this is intended to be a
stop-gap single release. See [[https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/][Yomitan]] for an actual longer-term project that
follows in the spirit of Yomichan.

Yomitan project wishes to have a public release only after some major kinks
have been ironed out but I think importing and exporting database is a useful
enough feature to release something just for it hence why this exists.

While I was working on this, a stupidly annoying audio bug also popped up with
Firefox and a fix is included in this release FWIW. Credits to
[[https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan/pull/186/commits/1ad09c47fbda0bf6182dc06315ab1030cc66c0ad][Aquafina-water-bottle]] for the fix.

See [[https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan#readme][Yomichan REAMDE]] for the documentation about everything yomichan other than
this new feature. Also present in this repository as [[file:Yomichan_README.md][Yomichan_README.md]].

* Installation

** Firefox

Download [[https://github.com/forsakeninfinity/yomibaba/releases/download/22.11.3.6/yomibaba-firefox-signed-22.11.3.6.xpi][yomibaba-firefox-signed-22.11.3.6.xpi]] and drag it onto your Firefox window, or
just double click it.

** Chromium based browsers on a computer

+ Download [[https://github.com/forsakeninfinity/yomibaba/releases/download/22.11.3.6/yomibaba-chrome.zip][yomibaba-chrome.zip]] and unzip it somewhere
+ Go to =chrome://extensions/= and turn on developer mode from the top right
+ Click =Load unpacked= and select the unzipped folder

** Chromium based browsers on mobile (i.e., Kiwi)
+ If you are on a mobile device and using a Chromium based browser like Kiwi,
  install using the [[https://github.com/forsakeninfinity/yomibaba/releases/download/22.11.3.6/yomibaba-chrome.crx][yomibaba-chrome.crx]] file instead. Loading unpacked
  extensions with a zip apparently causes the Android cache cleanup to reap
  them occasionally. This hasn't been tested with any other mobile browser fwiw
  so your mileage may vary.

* Usage

** Exporting the dictionary database from Yomichan

Existing Yomichan extension installations don't have the code that lets you
export the database. Which means that we have no choice but to inject and run
the code on top of the extension somehow. I have instructions on how to do that
in this repository:
https://github.com/forsakeninfinity/yomichan-data-exporter#steps-to-export-the-data

If you are migrating from Yomichan like this, you should strongly consider also
exporting your settings from the =Backup= section of Yomichan's Settings page
and importing those in Yomibaba so that you get your exact setup back.

** Importing the dictionary database

- Go to Yomibaba's settings page (Click on the extension's icon then click on
  the cog icon from the popup).
- Click =Import Dictionary Data= and select the database file you want to import
- Wait for the import to finish then turn all the dictionaries back on from the
  =Dictionaries > Configure installed and enabled dictionaries= section
- Refresh the browser tab to see the dictionaries in effect
- Restart the browser if you keep running into issues

** Exporting the database from Yomibaba

- Just click =Export Dictionary Data= from the backup section of Yomibaba's settings page
- It will show you a progress report as it exports the data then initiates a
  download for a file named something like
  =yomibaba-dictionaries-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.json=
  (e.g. =yomibaba-dictionaries-2023-07-05-02-42-04.json=)

** Consider compressing the data for sharing and archival

Note that the exported file is going to be rather large (likely a few
gigabytes, depending on the size of your collection). You should consider
compressing it if you are sharing (or archiving) the data over the
internet. For example, I get 10x+ compression without loss for [[* Brand new users][the beginner
database I share further below]] which could matter a lot for people with slow
(or bandwidth-limited) internet.

You can run the following command on a POSIX shell (if you are on windows, I
strongly recommend installing [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][git bash]] just to get one), to compress the file
that was exported. Replace the filename with the appropriate name that was
generated and downloaded and run the command from the same folder where the
file was downloaded to.
#+begin_src sh
exported_filename="yomibaba-dictionaries-beginners-2023-07-08-05-28-08.json"; XZ_OPT="-9e -T0" tar -Jcvf "${exported_filename%.json}.tar.xz" "$exported_filename"
#+end_src

This will take a fair bit of time as it is trying to compress the file to the
maximum possible level. Drop the =XZ_OPT= bits from the command if you'd rather
have it compress faster even if the resulting size is larger.

You can also use [[https://www.7-zip.org/][7-zip]] with =Ultra= compression level and =LZMA2= compression
level to compress the file if you prefer. It results in slightly bigger
filesize, but it's not too bad. It's essentially equivalent to dropping the
=XZ_OPT= bits from the tar command above.

* Brand new users

If you are a completely new user who hasn't used Yomichan before then you can
import dictionaries one by one from the settings page, or you can download and
import someone else's database.

Here's a starter configuration intended for beginners:
[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLLsyB1MZ_HDdRLVceyjImqH-rQOWy2f/view?usp=sharing][yomibaba-dictionaries-beginners-2023-07-08-05-28-08.json]]

Compressed version of the above to save on bandwidth:
[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cGIiqaAQ_AaXaTjfhrINw-rJwz9li7nK/view?usp=sharing][yomibaba-dictionaries-beginners-2023-07-08-05-28-08.tar.xz]]

You can run the following command from a POXIS shell to unzip the above (from
the folder where you downloaded it):
#+begin_src sh
tar -xf yomibaba-dictionaries-beginners-2023-07-08-05-28-08.tar.xz
#+end_src

Or you can use [[https://www.7-zip.org/][7-zip]] if you are on windows and want a GUI, but you will have to
unpack twice from the GUI (once to get the tar file and again to get the actual
JSON).

It comes with the following dictionaries installed:
+ [[https://github.com/aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan][JMDICT extra with examples]] which is the most comprehensive JP-EN dictionary
+ =三省堂国語辞典　第七版= which is a JP-JP dictionary that is very
  beginner-friendly with short definitions and I would recommend keeping it on
  even as a beginner
+ =新和英= which is another JP-EN dictionary. You may want to keep this off if
  you are a complete beginner just to have less clutter but a couple of
  dictionaries don't hurt.
+ =デジタル大辞泉= which is another JP-JP dictionary that is very
  comprehensive. You may want to keep this off if you are a complete beginner.
+ =JMnedict= which is a dictionary of names
+ =日本語文法辞典(全集)= aka =Dictionary of Japanense Grammar (DOJG)= is a
  grammar dictionary based on
  https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/dojgmain
+ =JLPT文法解説まとめ= aka =Nihongo Kyoshi= which is a grammar dictionary based
  on https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/. As this is a monolingual
  dictionary with only Japanese definitions, you may want to keep this off as a
  complete beginner too.
+ =KANJIDIC (English)= which is a kanji dictionary. I would caution against
  worrying about Kanji too much as a beginner. Vocabulary (words, grammar
  terms) are much more important.
+ =アクセント辞典= which is a pitch accent dictionary. You also needn't worry
  _too much_ about pitch accent at the start, but it is useful to have an idea
  that it is a thing. See https://morg.systems/0308ae14
+ =CC100= which is a frequency dictionary that ranks terms based on how
  commonly used they are and I recommend using it to sort your results
  (by selecting it from =General > Frequency sorting dictionary=)
+ =JPDB= which is also a frequency dictionary based on data from http://jpdb.io

the above and much more.
